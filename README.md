# Bomberman
CS319 Group Project

Bomberman game will be created throught the semester.

Bombplan is a brand-new version of classical Bomberman game. The main aim in Bomberman is to reach to exit door without being killed by the monsters in the game. The main character has the power to plant the bombs in different locations on the map. The map is in form of a maze and there are some wall blocks that can be destroyed by the bombs and some others that can never be destroyed. The character starts from one end of the maze and by destroying the suitable walls and running away from the monsters, tries to reach to the exit door. The bombs are not only affective on the walls, if there is the main character or one of the monsters in the range of the bomb, they can also be destroyed.
